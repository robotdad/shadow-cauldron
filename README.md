  - [Gemini CLI](https://developers.google.com/gemini/cli)
- Python 3.11+ or Node.js 18+
- Git

### 1. Create Your Project

1.  Click the **Use this template** button on the GitHub repository page.
2.  Give your new repository a name and create it.
3.  Clone your new repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-new-repo-name].git
cd [your-new-repo-name]
```

### 2. First AI Assistant Session

```
# In your AI assistant, use the command:
/prime

# This will:
# - Install all dependencies
# - Activate your environment
# - Load philosophy documents
# - Run initial checks
# - Confirm everything works
```

### 3. Try Your First Task

```
/ultrathink-task Create a simple web API that:
- Has a health check endpoint
- Stores data in memory
- Returns JSON responses
- Includes proper error handling
- Has tests

Follow our philosophy of simplicity and pragmatism.
```

Watch as multiple AI agents collaborate to build your API with tests, error handling, and documentation.

### 4. Experience the Flow

Make any code change and watch:

- 🔔 Desktop notification when complete
- ✅ Automatic quality checks run
- 📝 Clear feedback in your terminal
- 🎯 Stay focused on your next idea

## 📖 User Guides

### 🎨 For Product Managers

**Your New Superpower: Prototype at the Speed of Thought**

```
/ultrathink-task I need a dashboard that shows:
- User growth over time with a nice chart
- Current active users in real-time
- Revenue metrics with month-over-month change
- Mobile responsive design
- Export to PDF functionality

Make it look professional but keep it simple.
```

**What Happens Next:**

1. Architect designs the component structure
2. Research finds best charting libraries
3. Coder implements with your requirements

5. You get a working dashboard in minutes

**Pro Tips:**

- Drop mockups in `ai_working/` for reference
- Use `/test-webapp-ui` to see it in action
- Iterate with natural language: "Make the charts bigger"

### 👩‍💻 For Engineers

**Your New Reality: Deep Work Without Interruptions**

```bash
# Set up context for your feature
echo "API Schema: ..." > ai_context/api-spec.md
echo "Database Models: ..." > ai_context/models.md

# Let AI help with implementation
/ultrathink-task Implement the user authentication system based on:
